### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

-   At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
-   At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

-   [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
-   [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
-   [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
-   [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="584" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),
-   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
-   implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CompanyListPanel`, `CompanyDetailPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

-   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
-   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
-   keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a company).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

-   When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
-   All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

-   stores the address book data i.e., all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object).
-   stores the currently 'selected' `Company` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
    which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Company>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
    bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
-   stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
-   does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="472" />

</div>

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="627" />

The `Storage` component,

-   can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
-   inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## 4. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Company detail panel (UI component)

The `CompanyDetailPanel` allows user to view the company details of the selected company in the company list.
The user can use the `view` command to select the company to view.

#### 4.1.1 Implementation

The company detail panel UI component is achieved by creating a new `UniqueCompanyList` in `AddressBook` to
store the selected company which the user wishes to view. Additionally, the following operations are implemented in
`AddressBook` to support the `view` and other commands:

-   `setCurrentViewedCompany(Company company)` - Sets the selected company to be viewed.
-   `clearDetailPanel()` - Clears the `UniqueCompanyList` to remove the selected company from the company detail panel.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setCurrentViewedCompany(Company company)` and
`Model#checkDelete()` respectively.

The `view` function is implemented in the `ViewCommand` class which calls `Model#setCurrentViewedCopany(Company company)`
to insert the selected company into the `UniqueCompanyList`.
The follow sequence diagram depicts how the `view` command is executed.

<img src="images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png" />

Since only the detail of one company will be displayed anytime, `Model#setCurrentViewedCopany(Company company)` will
clear the `UniqueCompanyList` before inserting the selected company.
Since `UniqueCompanyList` is an observable list, the `CompanyDetailPanel` will be updated automatically
when there is any changes made to the `UniqueCompanyList`

When the `edit`, `add`, `view` or `delete` command is executed, the `CompanyDetailPanel` will be updated respectively as
shown in the activity diagram below.

<img src="images/CompanyDetailPanelActivityDiagram.png" width="400"/>

#### 4.1.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: How details of the company is displayed**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display the details of the company in a separate panel.

    -   Pros: The information is well compartmentalized. This improves the user viewing experience.
    -   Cons: More commands are needed to view the details of the company.

-   **Alternative 2:** Display the details of the company in the same panel as the company list.
    -   Pros: User does not need to key in additional commands to view the details of the company.
    -   Cons: The company list panel will be too cluttered with too much information displayed in a company card.

**Aspect: How the company to be viewed is stored in the `AddressBook`**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `UniqueCompanyList` in `AddressBook` to store the selected company which the user wishes to view.

    -   Pros: Since the `UniqueCompanyList` is an observable list, the `CompanyDetailPanel` will be updated automatically when there is any changes made to the `UniqueCompanyList`.
    -   Cons: There is a need to clear the list before adding the selected company to the `UniqueCompanyList` to ensure that only one company is displayed in the `CompanyDetailPanel` at any time.

-   **Alternative 2:** Create a new `Company` object in `AddressBook` to store the selected company which the user wishes to view.
    -   Pros: It is intuitive to create a new `Company` object to store the selected company which the user wishes to view.
    -   Cons: The `CompanyDetailPanel` will not be updated automatically when there is any changes made to the `Company`
        object. There is a need to create additional methods to update the `CompanyDetailPanel` when there is any changes
        made to the `Company` object.

### 4.2 Find command

#### 4.2.1 Implementation

The `find` command allows users to search for companies using one or more keywords. Companies matching any of the keywords in their names will be returned. This search is case-insensitive, and partial matches are valid. The critical change in the implementation centers around the modification of the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class.

##### How `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` Works:

Previously, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` was designed to match a company name against a whole keyword. However, the modified implementation allows it to test a company's name against substrings and return true if the comapany's name contains the substring .

When `find` is executed, it uses the `Model` interface's `updateFilteredCompanyList(Predicate<Company> predicate)` method, passing in the modified `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to filter the list of companies.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the processing of a `find` command, such as `find Micr`:

<img src="images/FindCompanySequenceDiagram.png"/>

> :information_source: **Note:** The above sequence diagram simplifies the interaction by focusing on the primary components involved in processing the `find` command.

#### 4.2.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Approach to matching keywords**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Match company names that contain the keyword **anywhere** within them.

    -   Pros: Flexible search, allows partial keyword matching.
    -   Cons: Might produce more results than expected.

-   **Alternative 2:** Match company names that **start** with the given keyword.

    -   Pros: Precise results.
    -   Cons: Might omit some relevant results if user does not remember the exact start of the company's name.

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive matching.

    -   Pros: User-friendly; users don’t need to remember exact case.
    -   Cons: Might produce a broader range of results.

-   **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive matching.

    -   Pros: More exact matches.
    -   Cons: Less user-friendly, especially if users do not recall the exact case of company names.

With the design considerations, we've chosen the alternatives that provide a balance between user-friendliness and precision.

### 4.3 Filter Command

The `filter` command allows user to filter the company list by the application status. The following sequence diagram
will illustrate the process of performing the `filter` command.

<img src="images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png"/>

#### 4.3.1 Implementation

The `filter` function is implemented in the `FilterCommand` class and uses the `FilterCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments. The predicate class implementing `Predicate<Company>` is `ApplicationStatusPredicate`.
- `ApplicationStatusPredicate` - Predicate to check if the company's application status is the same as the application
  status specified in the command.

#### 4.3.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: UI of the filter command**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The company details panel will be cleared whenever the filter command is executed.
    - Pros: Users can focus on viewing details of company belonging to the filtered list only, reducing distractions and confusions.
    - Cons: Users might have to execute the `view` command again to access details of the company that is selected even
      if that company is in the filtered list, potentially leading to additional steps.

- **Alternative 2:** The company details panel will still display the details of the company that was selected before the
  filter command is executed.
    - Pros: Users can still view the details of the company in the company details panel alongside the filtered list of companies.
    - Cons: Users may be confused as the currently viewed company in the company details panel may not be in the
      filtered list of companies.

### 4.4 Edit feature

#### 4.4.1 Implementation
The edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditCompanyDescriptor`. It is a nested class of `EditCommand` that stores the edited fields of a company and unedited fields to be `null`.
Additionally, `EditCommand` implements the following operations:

* `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` — Edits all the attributes indicated in user input.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setCompany(Company target, Company editedCompany)`.

Given below is the sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works.
<img src="images/EditSequenceDiagram.png"/>

After the `EditCommandParser` initializes an `EditCompanyDescriptor` object, it sets the attributes of `EditCompanyDescriptor` that needs to be edited to the values input by the user.
When `EditCommand#execute()` is called, a `Company` object, `c`, with edited attributes is initialized since `Company` is immutable.
When `Model#setCompany(Company company)` is called, the original `Company` object in the `AddressBook` is replaced with the edited Company `c`.

#### 4.4.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to edit different attributes of a company**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edits all attributes using one command.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: More prone to errors and bugs/ require more test cases for code coverage.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a command to edit each attribute.
    * Pros: Command line is shorter which reduces users' error such as duplicates or invalid command. This improves user experience.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. This may also require more memory usage, a Company object is initialized for every modified attribute.

### 4.5 Delete Command

The `delete` command allows user to delete a company using the observed index (one-based index) of the company.
The following sequence diagram will illustrate the process of performing the `delete` command.

<img src="images/DeleteCompanySequenceDiagram.png"/>

#### 4.5.1 Implementation

The `delete` function is implemented in the `DeleteCommand` class and uses the `DeleteCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments. The LogicManger#execute() method will retrieve the filtered company list from the model, perform zero-based
indexing to the supplied Index, get the company associated with the index and requests model to `delete` the company.

#### 4.5.2 Design Considerations
**Aspect: Coupling between `DeleteCommand` and `FilterCommand`**
- **Alternative:** The delete function can be performed by the `DeleteCommand` class without having to
  retrieve the filtered company list from the model.
    - Pros: The `DeleteCommand` class will be simpler and easier to understand.
    - Cons: The `DeleteCommand` class will be tightly coupled with the `FilterCommand` class.

**Aspect: Type of company deletion input from the user**
- **Alternative:** Instead of one-based index input from the user, require the user to enter the company name
  to be deleted.
    - Pros: The user does not need to remember the index of the company to be deleted.
    - Cons: The user may enter the wrong company name to be deleted.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

-   `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th company in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new company. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the company was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="308" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

    -   Pros: Easy to implement.
    -   Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

-   **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
    itself.
    -   Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the company being deleted).
    -   Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
